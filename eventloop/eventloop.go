// Package eventloop runs a moejs Runtime on an event loop: the Node.js
// timers (setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate and their clear functions)
// and host work whose result comes back from another goroutine.
//
// A bare Runtime has no timers, and the settle functions of
// Runtime.NewPromise may only be called from the goroutine that uses the
// runtime. A Loop owns its runtime while it runs, and is the one goroutine
// that uses it then:
//
//	rt := moejs.NewRuntime(moejs.Options{})
//	loop, err := eventloop.New(rt, eventloop.Options{})
//	err = loop.Run(func(rt *moejs.Runtime) error {
//		_, err := rt.RunScript(script) // may call setTimeout
//		return err
//	})
//
// Run returns once nothing keeps the loop alive: no timer or immediate that
// is ref'd, no Hold not yet done, no promise of NewPromise not yet settled
// and no task not yet run. Other goroutines hand work to the loop with
// RunOnLoop, and a host function whose result comes from another goroutine
// returns a promise of NewPromise. Between runs the runtime is the host's
// again.
//
// # Phases
//
// One iteration of the loop has three phases, as Node's timers, poll and
// check phases: the timers due when the phase starts, in order of expiry,
// then of scheduling; the tasks posted before the phase started (RunOnLoop,
// Post, the done function of Hold, the settle function of NewPromise); the
// immediates set before the phase started. The promise jobs and
// queueMicrotask callbacks a callback or task queues run when it returns,
// before the next one. With nothing to run, the loop sleeps until the next
// timer is due or a task is posted.
//
// # Timers
//
// The timer functions follow Node.js:
//   - setTimeout and setInterval return a Timeout object with the methods
//     ref, unref, hasRef, refresh, close and Symbol.toPrimitive, which
//     returns the timer's numeric id; setImmediate returns an Immediate
//     with ref, unref and hasRef.
//   - The callback gets the extra arguments, and the Timeout or Immediate
//     as this. A callback that is not a function is a TypeError with the
//     code ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE; a string is not evaluated.
//   - The delay goes through ToNumber and is truncated to whole
//     milliseconds. NaN, a delay below 1 and one above 2147483647 are 1 ms,
//     so a timer set by a callback runs in a later iteration.
//   - An interval is rescheduled for its delay after the time its callback
//     started. refresh restarts a timer's delay from now, and runs a
//     timeout that already fired again; a cleared timer stays cleared.
//   - clearTimeout and clearInterval take a Timeout, or the id its
//     Symbol.toPrimitive returned, as a number or a string, once that was
//     read; clearImmediate takes an Immediate. They ignore anything else,
//     and work inside the timer's own callback.
//   - An unref'd timer or immediate does not keep Run alive, and runs only
//     while something else does.
//
// Differences from Node: the Timeout and Immediate objects have no own
// properties (JSON.stringify gives {}, and constructor.name is "Object"),
// their methods throw a TypeError when called on another object, a Proxy of
// one included, and a Timeout has no Symbol.dispose method. Timers expire
// in the order of their exact due times, where Node compares whole
// milliseconds. timers/promises, the AbortSignal options, util.promisify
// and Node's warning for a delay above 2147483647 are not provided.
//
// # Errors and interrupts
//
// A callback's exception stops the loop, as an uncaught exception ends a
// Node.js process, unless Options.OnError takes it. An interrupt always
// stops it, before it takes the next timer, task or immediate off its
// queues, which keep them. A loop is interrupted through Loop.Interrupt:
// Runtime.Interrupt alone stops the JavaScript running but does not wake a
// loop that sleeps. A rejection no handler catches is the host's business,
// through Runtime.SetPromiseRejectionTracker.
//
// # Memory limit
//
// Options.MemoryLimit of the runtime bounds what the program keeps plus
// what it allocates, over the whole run: Run, or Start until Stop, starts
// a new budget (Runtime.ResetAllocation, which keeps the last measurement
// of what the program retains), and before each timer or immediate
// callback and each task the loop rebases it instead of resetting it
// (Runtime.RebaseAllocation): once enough was allocated since the last
// measurement, it measures what the runtime's JavaScript retains and counts
// that in place of what was allocated. Where an allocation would pass the
// limit before then, the runtime measures first (for an allocation a
// builtin makes, at the latest before the next callback), and stops the
// program only when it keeps too much. The measurement reaches what the loop holds for JavaScript, the
// callbacks and arguments of the pending timers and immediates and the
// promises of NewPromise not yet settled, and through them the async
// functions awaiting those promises: the loop registers them with
// Runtime.AddLiveRoots once the runtime has a limit, and Terminate removes
// them, so that a runtime that gets a new Loop does not keep the old one.
// It does not see values
// only the host's Go code holds, such as the captures of a task posted
// with RunOnLoop, unless the host registers them too. A program that keeps
// what it allocates, across however many callbacks and runs, stops near
// the limit; one that keeps little runs on, however much it allocates in
// all. The loop holds its mutex only while it adds its roots, not while
// the measurement walks the heap, so goroutines that post tasks or settle
// promises do not wait for it. Without a limit the loop does no work for
// it.
//
// A callback that passes the limit stops the loop with its
// *moejs.InterruptedError, as any interrupt does, and so does a
// measurement that finds the program keeps more than the limit: the loop
// interrupts the runtime with the *moejs.MemoryLimitError before it takes
// the next timer, task or immediate off its queues. Either way errors.Is
// finds moejs.ErrMemoryLimit in what Run (or Stop) returns, and the
// interrupt stays pending (Runtime.ClearInterrupt).
//
// Options.ResetMemoryPerTask restores the budget of earlier versions: a
// new one before each callback and task, with the promise jobs it queues.
// The limit then bounds what one macrotask allocates, not what the program
// keeps alive between them.
