// Live measurement (MeasureLive, RebaseAllocation).
//
// The memory limit charges what a realm allocates and credits nothing
// back (memlimit.go), so on its own it bounds what was allocated since the
// last reset. A host whose program outlives one request, an event loop
// that keeps it between callbacks, rebases the account instead of
// resetting it: RebaseAllocation measures what the realm's heap retains
// and makes that the account's base (lastLive), so that the limit bounds
// what the program keeps plus what it allocated since.
//
// The measurement walks the heap reachable from the realm's roots, the
// ones hosts registered (AddLiveRoots) and the ones the caller adds, each
// node once, and sums what the charge points charge for it: an object by
// the size of its struct and payload, the storage of its properties and
// elements, an environment by its slots, a suspended frame by its
// registers, a string by its header and units (an append buffer, and the
// string whose units a substring or a JSON value shares, once), a Map or
// Set by its table, an ArrayBuffer by its bytes (once for the buffers that
// share them), a promise by its reactions, a BigInt by its words, a shape
// of the realm's own tree with its key, the code eval and the Function
// constructors compiled. A WeakMap's value counts while both its key and
// the map are reached. The walk is iterative, so a deep structure costs no
// Go stack, and it ends early when the realm is interrupted meanwhile.
//
// What it does not count: what is shared by every realm of the process
// (the frozen intrinsics of a SharedIntrinsics realm, the shared shape
// tree, compiled templates with their string constants, compiled regular
// expressions); the intrinsic objects of a mutable realm themselves, whose
// properties it does walk, since a program can hang data on
// Array.prototype; the Go values of the host nodes FromGo made that
// JavaScript has not read yet; and every value only Go code holds: what a
// NativeFunc's closure captured, a promise only the settle functions of
// Runtime.NewPromise keep, a pending task of a host's queue. The host
// passes those as roots, or registers them (AddLiveRoots). What the Go
// state of a host's object keeps counts when that state, the object's
// payload, implements LiveReporter.
