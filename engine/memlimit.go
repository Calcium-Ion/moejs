// Memory limit (docs/DESIGN.md §4.4).
//
// A realm with a memory limit charges what it allocates for JavaScript to
// an account behind r.lazy: objects by the size of their struct, the
// storage of their properties and elements as it grows, strings by their
// header and units, Map and Set tables, ArrayBuffers, environments,
// suspended generator frames, BigInt results, the code eval and the
// Function constructors compile, and the wrappers FromGo and JSON.parse
// build. The count is approximate: a producer charges what it asks the Go
// allocator for, not the size class it gets, and the places that grow a
// slice without one of the charge points below are not counted, nor are
// the register stack and frame table, which the call depth limit bounds.
// Nothing is credited back as it is freed: the account counts allocation
// since the last reset (ReleaseCallData, ResetAllocation) or measurement.
//
// A measurement of what the realm's heap retains (memlive.go), lastLive,
// replaces the allocation counted until then, so that the limit bounds
// what the program keeps plus what it allocated since the measurement. A
// host that keeps a program alive across requests or callbacks (an event
// loop) measures between them (RebaseAllocation); a reset zeroes the
// allocation and keeps the measurement, so what the program keeps across
// requests still counts.
//
// When lastLive plus the bytes allocated since the last reset or
// measurement pass the limit, the realm measures its heap (remeasure): the
// first time between two resets or rebases, with or without a measurement
// before, and again as RebaseAllocation's pacing allows. It does so only
// where no builtin may hold what it made where the walk cannot reach it:
// in interpreted code, and in the callbacks of the builtins that keep what
// they build on the register stack or report it (memlive.go, remeasure).
// While another builtin runs, or the host's ParseJSONString or FromGo, the
// charges stand within a slack past the limit (half of what it leaves,
// plus the one allocation that crosses that), and the interpreter measures
// once the native returns or at its next frame entry, as the drain does
// between promise jobs. The host's Go code outside any call, and its ChargeMemory
// where no script runs, measure at once, as RebaseAllocation does.
// The realm interrupts itself with a *MemoryLimitError when the
// measurement passes the limit too, or when no measurement may be made.
// Allocation cannot fail (initObject and initArray return no error), and
// an interrupt unwinds without running any catch or finally and drops the
// queued jobs, so a script cannot catch the hit and keep allocating. The
// producers that know a result's size before they allocate it, and throw
// a RangeError for a size past the engine's limits (String.prototype.repeat,
// new ArrayBuffer, a BigInt shift), throw the same RangeError for a size
// past what is left of the budget, which the script can catch.
//
// With no limit set r.lazy.mem is nil, and a charge point costs the loads
// of r.lazy and its mem field: the account, and every counter it keeps,
// exists only while a limit is set.
