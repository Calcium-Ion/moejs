// CallFunction calls the function fn with this and args, for a host that
// calls a function JavaScript gave it, such as a callback passed to a host
// function, after that call returned. It works as Call does: a value that is
// not a function is ErrNotCallable; a throw is an *Exception, an interrupt
// an *InterruptedError, also one that arrived before a host function fn
// runs, and a Go panic below it an *InternalError; fn, this or an argument
// that is a function or generator of another runtime is ErrForeign. The
// jobs the call queues run before it returns, and the first exception they
// throw is its error when it succeeded otherwise. Called inside another call
// (from a host function), it leaves them to the end of the outermost one,
// and its *InternalError goes to that host function: returned to
// JavaScript like any other Go error, it is thrown as an Error that
// JavaScript can catch, and reaches the outermost call, uncaught, as an
// *Exception that unwraps to it.

// to give JavaScript the error a host function would have thrown. ok is
// false for nil and for an *InterruptedError, which JavaScript cannot
// catch. An *Exception must come from this runtime: one of another runtime
// gives that runtime's value, which this one must not use (Runtime). No
