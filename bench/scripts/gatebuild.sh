# gatebuild.sh <tree> <outdir> <name>: the test binaries of the plugin-
# workload gate (docs/DESIGN.md §14.2) for the checkout <tree>, as
# <outdir>/{engine,root,bench}-<name>.test, for gateab.sh.

# They link with -funcalign=64. By default amd64 aligns functions to 32
# bytes, so a change anywhere before a hot function moves it by 32 within
# its 64-byte line, and that alone moves some rows by up to 10 % (docs/
# NOTES.md "LoopSum and the alignment of (*Realm).run"). With every
# function on a 64-byte boundary a function's placement depends on its own
# code only. The flag is the linker's, so any commit builds this way.
#
# PAD=<bytes> links a function of about that many bytes, never called, at
# the end of package bytecode, the first moejs package the linker lays
# out, so syntax, compiler, engine and all code linked after them move by
# PAD bytes against the Go runtime. Where the engine's hot code lands
# against the runtime's (the allocator, map lookups) decides how often
# their branches and lines collide in the CPU's branch target buffer and
# instruction cache: moving an unchanged engine alone moves front-end-bound
# rows such as PluginHook by 5-20 % (docs/NOTES.md "Code layout
# (2026-10)"). gateab.sh PADS=... runs its rounds over several such
# placements. The pad comes in through go build -overlay; the checkout is
# not touched.
